== Short Biography
I received my B.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in the School of Computer Science and Technology from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2014 and 2020, respectively, under the supervision of [https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~xin/ Prof. Xin Yao] from University of Birminghan and [http://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/tangk3/en/ Prof. Ke Tang] from USTC.

I joined the [https://cse.sustech.edu.cn/ Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)], [https://sustech.edu.cn/ Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)] in September 2020, as a Research Assistant Professor.
I am also a member of the Nature Inspired Computation and Applications Laboratory ([http://www.nical.ai/ NICAL]) led by [https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~xin/ Prof. Xin Yao] and [http://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/tangk3/en/ Prof. Ke Tang].

== Research Interest
The utimate goal of my research is to develop theoretical foundations and practical tools for fully automating the process of algorithm design. Now I am working on:
- Automatic Algorithm Design by Evolutionary Computation, i.e., Algorithm Evolution
- Robust and well-generalized Neural Combinatorial Optimizers (Learn to Optimize)
- Efficient and effective algorithms for black/grey-box combinatorial optimization problems arising in real-world applications

== Recent News
- Aug 2, 2022: One paper accepted by CIKM'2022
- Jul 18, 2022: I (together with Prof. Ke Tang) gave a tutorial "Learn to Optimize" at WCCI 2022.
- Apr 15, 2022: One paper accepted by ICSI'2022.
