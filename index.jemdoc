# == Short Biography
I received my B.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in the School of Computer Science and Technology from USTC in 2014 and 2020, respectively, advised by [https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~xin/ Prof. Xin Yao] and [http://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/tangk3/en/ Prof. Ke Tang].
From Jan 2021 to Jan 2023, I was a Research Assistant Professor at the CSE Department of SUSTech.
From Jan 2023 to May 2024, I was a Visiting Professor, and later a senior scientist, at CFAR, A*STAR, Singapore, in collaboration with [https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/asysong/home.html Prof. Yew-Soon Ong] from NTU.
I am also a member of the Nature Inspired Computation and Applications Laboratory ([http://www.nical.ai/ NICAL]) led by Prof. Xin Yao and Prof. Ke Tang.

== Research Interest
Ultimately, I am obsessed with the theoretical foundations and practical approaches for *the fully-automated design of optimizers that can generalize*.

Now I am interested in:
- Learning easy-to-use, general-purpose, scalable optimizers for discrete optimization problems
- Learning optimizers for applications with huge impact, e.g., industry software and web applications
# these methods to practical combinatorial optimization problems such as evaluation of the robustness/safety of AI models (such as large language models), complex vehicle routing, influence blocking maximization, and 5G network end-to-end configuration
# - Highly-effective automatically-designed algorithms for adversarial attack and robustness
# - Efficient and effective algorithms for black/grey-box combinatorial optimization problems arising in real-world applications, e.g., adversarial attack

\<span style=\"color\: red\;\"\>I am looking for self-motivated Master students, Ph.D. students, Postdocs, and research assistants (RA), working in the above research directions. If you are interested, please feel free to contact me via emails.\</span>
