== Short Biography
I received my B.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in the School of Computer Science and Technology from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2014 and 2020, respectively, under the supervision of [https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~xin/ Prof. Xin Yao] and [http://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/tangk3/en/ Prof. Ke Tang].

From Jan 2021 to Jan 2023, I was a Research Assistant Professor at the [https://cse.sustech.edu.cn/ Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)], [https://sustech.edu.cn/ Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)].
I am also a member of the Nature Inspired Computation and Applications Laboratory ([http://www.nical.ai/ NICAL]) led by [https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~xin/ Prof. Xin Yao] and [http://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/tangk3/en/ Prof. Ke Tang].

From Jan 2023 to May 2023, I was a Visting Professor at the Institute of High Performance Computing (IHPC), A*STAR, Singapore. Currently I am a research scientist at IHPC. I am in collaboration with [https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/asysong/home.html Prof. Yew-Soon Ong] from Nanyang Technological University (NTU).

== Research Interest
The utimate goal of my research is to develop theoretical foundations and practical tools for fully automating the process of algorithm design.

Now I am working on:
- Automatic Algorithm Design by Evolutionary Computation, i.e., Algorithm Evolution
- Robust and well-generalized Neural Combinatorial Optimizers (Learn to Optimize)
- Highly-effective automatically-designed algorithms for adversarial attack and robustness
# - Efficient and effective algorithms for black/grey-box combinatorial optimization problems arising in real-world applications, e.g., adversarial attack
